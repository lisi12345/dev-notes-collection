# Running an Existing React Native Application on a Mac for the First Time

This guide is for first-time Mac users who want to run an existing React Native application. It includes the detailed steps I followed. The current date is 1/8/2025, and I’m using the 2024 Mac Mini basic version (the cheapest model). I’ve already successfully run the React Native project on my Windows laptop, where it worked with the Android simulator. Therefore, this guide won’t cover how to build your first React Native app; that’s a separate note.

## 1. Download the Essential Applications

1. **Xcode**: Download it from the App Store.
2. **Visual Studio Code**: Download it from [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).
3. **Android Studio** (Optional): If you want to run the app on an Android simulator, download it from [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio). In this guide, I’ll focus on running React Native using Xcode and will skip Android Studio.

## 2. Install the Applications

If you’re familiar with using a Mac, you probably know how to install applications. However, as a first-time Mac user, I found this process slightly confusing, so I think these steps will be helpful for others like me.

### Installing Applications from the App Store
- If you download an application from the App Store, the installation process is automatic, and you don’t need to worry about additional steps.

### Installing Applications Downloaded from a Website
If you download an application from a website, the file will typically be saved in the **Downloads** directory. Follow these steps to install it:

1. Open **Finder**. The Finder icon looks like a smiley face (half blue, half gray) and is usually the first icon on the Dock. Alternatively, you can find it at the top left of your screen, next to the Apple icon.
2. In Finder's left sidebar, click on **Downloads**. This is where your downloaded files/folders are located.
3. Double-click the `.dmg` file you downloaded.
4. A pop-up window will appear, showing the app's icon and a shortcut to the **Applications** folder. It will look something like this: ![alt text](image.png)
5. Click and hold the app’s icon (e.g., *Android Studio*).
6. Drag the app icon over to the **Applications** folder in Finder's sidebar.
7. Drop the app into the **Applications** folder to copy it.
8. Once the app finishes copying, double-click it in the **Applications** folder to confirm it was installed successfully.
9. To clean up, locate the `.dmg` file under **Locations** in Finder's sidebar.
10. Click the up arrow to eject the `.dmg` file or right-click on it and select **Eject**.
